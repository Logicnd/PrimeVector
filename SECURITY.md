# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities in the last major version. Make sure you are using the latest version of PrimeVector.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly. To report a vulnerability:

1. Do not publicly disclose the issue.
2. Email us at the security contact address provided in the project metadata with a detailed description of the vulnerability and steps to reproduce.
3. Allow us a reasonable amount of time to address the issue before public disclosure.

We will coordinate with you to confirm the vulnerability and plan the fix. We appreciate responsible disclosure and will acknowledge your contribution.

## Best Practices

We recommend that you:

- Keep your dependencies up to date.
- Use environment variables for secrets such as API keys and never commit them to version control.
- Review our [README.md](README.md) for installation and usage guidance.
